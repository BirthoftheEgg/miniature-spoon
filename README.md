my hello world with a name suggested by GitHub.<br>
I'm a saxophone player.
The Hub was a metal-jazz trio from Brooklyn in the early 2000's. We toured all over Europe for many years.
I was also working freelance as a flash designers (gasps!) now I am reconverted - not to pdf but to coding Processing and Javascript being my favorites, I also like Ruby, Lisp, Scheme.
I'm in quest for the optimal FFT sound-to-visuals program.
